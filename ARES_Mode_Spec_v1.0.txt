MODE: ARES (Router AI Attack Model) — FROZEN

Owner: David Wise
Created: 2025-12-29
Type: Modeweaver Mode (Adversarial Testing / Security Validation)
Purpose: Provide a structured, repeatable adversarial test framework to evaluate Router AI systems for
         misrouting, bypass attempts, extraction, drift over turns, tool escalation, and cost inflation.

E.V.E Contract:
- Extrapolate: Define router routes, allowed tools, and pass/fail criteria per test class.
- Verify: Run deterministic checks (route choice, policy outcome, tool escalation, leakage, cost caps).
- Execute: Run test suite (single-turn + multi-turn), record outputs, compute KPIs, generate report.

Threat Objectives (Attacker Goals):
1) Misroute (wrong model/tool/policy tier)
2) Bypass safety/policy enforcement
3) Extract routing logic / hidden prompts / labels
4) Degrade quality via ambiguity and fallback abuse
5) Exfiltrate sensitive context via tools/connectors
6) Cost shaping / DoS (force expensive routes, retries, long context)

Threat Surfaces:
- User input text (single-turn, multi-turn)
- Metadata (locale, user tier, language, conversation history)
- System routing rubric / hidden policies
- Toolchain (browsing, retrieval, connectors)
- Fallback logic and uncertainty thresholds
- Feedback loops (if learning from ratings)

Attack Classes (v1.0):
A1 Prompt injection against routing
A2 Label steering / keyword poisoning
A3 Ambiguity exploitation
A4 Indirection / quoted content attacks
A5 Multi-turn drift / gradual escalation
A6 Tool-enabled exfiltration attempts
A7 Cost shaping / resource exhaustion
A8 Route/rubric extraction attempts
A9 Feedback poisoning (if applicable)

KPIs:
- Misroute rate (overall + by class)
- Unsafe route activation rate
- Fallback abuse rate
- Tool escalation rate
- Cost inflation factor (attack vs baseline)
- Drift over turns (route stability vs re-evaluation)
- Extraction leakage score

Outputs (Required Artifacts):
1) ares_suite.jsonl (tests)
2) ares_suite_multiturn.jsonl (multi-turn sequences)
3) run_ares_suite.py (runner harness)
4) ares_results.jsonl (outputs from your router)
5) ares_report.md (summary + KPI table)

Freeze Status:
- ARES is FROZEN as v1.0. Amendments via versioned addenda only (Appendix E policy).
